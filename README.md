## Lead scoring case study
The goal of this case study is to identify the users who are likely to convert so the team at X Education can better allocate the man power.

Here are the steps for this case study- 
> 1. Data understanding 
> 2. Data preparation
>> 2.1. Categorical variables
>>> 2.1.1. Treating "Select" in certain columns \
>>> 2.1.2. Removing columns with high null values \
>>> 2.1.3. Removing columns with Zero or low variance
>>>
>> 2.2. Numeric variables
>>> 2.2.1. Outlier Treatment \
>>> 2.2.2. Feature Engineering \
>>> 2.2.3. Imputing Missing value
>>>
>>
> 3. Dummy variables creation
>> 3.1. Variables with null \
>> 3.2. Variables without null
>>
> 4. Model Building and evaluation
>> 4.1. Test-Train Split \
>> 4.2. Scaling \
>> 4.3. Building the model \
>> 4.4 Evaluting the model
>>> 4.4.1 Accuracy and related matrix \
>>> 4.4.2 Metrics beyond simply accuracy \
>>> 4.4.3 Plotting the ROC Curve 
>>> 
>> 4.5 Finding Optimal Cutoff Point
>>>
